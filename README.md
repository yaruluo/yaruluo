# Hi, I'm Ru ðŸŒ·
I'm so glad you're here! I'm Ru (she/hers/å¥¹) -- a student at the University of Michigan. I'm a writer who likes reading tons of Ursula K. Le Guin, an aspiring marathon runner, and a Yankees fan. It's great to meet you!ðŸŒ¿

## How I work
I read under the same particular tree at Battery Park almost every day for three years when I was in high school. I can get rote like that sometimes. When I do things I love, I tend to focus on the thing and forget everything else in the world. If I'm too much in my head, give me a nudge to share what's in my brain.ðŸ’«
